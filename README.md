## Overview

A food company has paired with a testing laboratory to determine what if any types of bacteria found in the human belly button can be used to synthesize and enhance the flavor of beef in beef substitues.  The lab has taken samples form the belly buttons of several study participants and supplied json file detailing what types of bacteria are found in each participants belly button and in what amounts.

The purpose of this project is to use that data to build an interactive dashboard to quickly display the top 10 bacteria found in for each participant in a bar chart, a bubble chart showing all the bacteria found for each participant, and a gauge showing the number of times per week each participant had their belly button washed to collect samples.

There is a dropdown menu that allows the dashboard user to select a specific participant by their ID # and update the charts to show the information for that participant.  As the lab and food company determine what bacteria will be best for synthesizing the beef flavor, they can use this dashboard to view each participant to see if they show a high pressence of that bacteria, making them ideal to participate in further studies.
